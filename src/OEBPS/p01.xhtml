	  	<p>I've made this to contain all the bits and pieces I've found scattered over the internet in one place. I hope it's useful and your improvements are obviously welcome.</p>
	  	<p>By no means is this an exhaustive example, and I take no responsibility for any problems that arise from this work, but I'm happy that it validates and works in iBooks as is, and serves as a practical guide, example and demonstration of the technology.</p>
